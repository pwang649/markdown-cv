## Experience

`Jun 2023 - Present`
__Research Assistant__, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA

- Advisor: Maxim Likhachev @ Search-Based Planning Lab
- Developed learning-based methods to tackle the 2D MAPF problem that could also guarantee completeness. Accepted to *ICAPS 2024*.
- Benchmarked and evaluated 3D MAPF problems using EECBS and MAPF-LNS2 methods. Accepted to *ICAPS 2024*.

`Jan 2023 - Jun 2023`
__Research Assistant__, USC, Los Angeles, CA

- Advisor: Viktor Prasanna @ Parallel Computing Lab
- Devised a novel approach to optimize the existing parallel DNN-MCTS algorithm by systematically choosing the best batch size for parallelization on GPU, resulting in a co-first author paper to *IA^3 2023*.

`Aug 2022 - Jun 2023`
__Research Assistant__, USC, Los Angeles, CA

- Advisor: Stefanos Nikolaidis @ ICAROS Lab
- Developed simulation software and real-life robotics demo using PyBullet and Aikido.
- Jointly developed CNN and heuristic-based methods and optimized placement accuracy to improve sampling efficiency in the geometric Task and Motion Planning (gTAMP) problem.

`May 2022 - Aug 2022`
__Software Engineer Intern__, Honeybee Robotics, Altadena, CA

- Built a YAMCS Studio operator console to interface with the ground station, displaying telemetry data and controlling a space mining drill.
- Crafted a simulator for the drill thatâ€™s able to emulate responses after receiving telecommand.

`Aug 2021 - May 2022`
__Undergraduate Research Fellow__, USC, Los Angeles, CA

- Advisor: Quan Nguyen @ Dynamic Robotics and Control Lab
- Worked on the design and control of a lightweight low-cost quadruped robot.
- Co-lead the software control sub-team and develop impedance control on the robot legs.
